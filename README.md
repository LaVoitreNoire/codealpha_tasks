Chatty - Python Chatbot is a simple text-based chatbot built using Python and NLTK. It can respond to greetings, simulate random weather conditions, tell jokes, perform basic math calculations, and have casual conversations through your terminal. To get started, ensure you have Python 3 installed and run pip install nltk to install the required library. The script also downloads the punkt tokenizer using nltk.download('punkt'), which is already included in the code. To run the chatbot, simply execute python chatbot.py from your terminal. Chatty will greet you and wait for your inputs such as "hello", "tell me a joke", "what's the weather like?", or even math expressions like "5 + 3 * 2". You can exit any time by typing "bye". The project is beginner-friendly and lightweight, using built-in logic and pattern matching without external APIs. Future improvements could include adding GUI, API integrations, or memory features. The code is open-source and available under the MIT License. Made with ❤️ using Python and NLTK.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. Then install the required Python packages:

### 🔧 Install Dependencies

``bash
pip install nltk
